# ⚡ Differences between Row-Level and Context-Level Filtering in DAX

The differences in Performance (Speed), Accuracy, and Efficiency Between 
 **Row-Level filtering (`FILTER`)** versus **Context-Level filtering (`CALCULATE` with direct conditions)** in Power BI.

---

## 🚀 **1. Speed (Performance) Differences**
| Method | Speed | Reason |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **CALCULATE (with direct filters)** | 🚀 **Faster** | Works on **column-level filters** and modifies the filter context efficiently. |
| **FILTER (row-level filtering)** | 🐢 **Slower** | Iterates through **each row** individually, increasing computation time. |

### ⚡ **Example: Performance Test**
#### 📌 **Scenario 1: Using `CALCULATE` for filtering**
```DAX
Total Sales Electronics =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]),
    Orders[Category] = "Electronics"
)
```
✅ **Faster** because Power BI directly **filters the column** and applies the condition in a single step.  

#### ⏳ **Scenario 2: Using `FILTER` for the same calculation**
```DAX
Total Sales Electronics Filter =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]),
    FILTER(Orders, Orders[Category] = "Electronics")
)
```
❌ **Slower** because:
1. `FILTER(Orders, Orders[Category] = "Electronics")` **loops through every row**.
2. It checks **each row individually** instead of applying a direct column filter.
3. Then, `SUM(Orders[Sales])` aggregates the results.

👉 **Conclusion**:  
- `CALCULATE` directly applies the filter at the **column level**, making it **more efficient**.  
- `FILTER` evaluates **row by row**, making it **slower**, especially for large datasets.

---

## 🎯 **2. Accuracy Differences**
| Method | Accuracy | Explanation |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **CALCULATE (with direct filters)** | ✅ **Accurate** | Works well when applying filters to columns globally. |
| **FILTER** | ✅ **Accurate** | Works well for **complex row-by-row conditions**, but must be used carefully. |

### 🧐 **Example Where `FILTER` Is More Accurate**
If we need to filter based on a condition that depends on **multiple columns**, `FILTER` is **more reliable**.

#### 🔍 **Scenario: Find total sales for orders where `Quantity > 10` but only for "Electronics"**
```DAX
Total Sales Large Electronics Orders =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]),
    FILTER(Orders, Orders[Quantity] > 10 && Orders[Category] = "Electronics")
)
```
✅ Here, `FILTER` is necessary because:
- We need to check **each row** where `Quantity > 10` **AND** `Category = Electronics`.
- `CALCULATE` alone cannot filter **two column conditions row by row**.

👉 **Conclusion**:  
- **Use `CALCULATE` when filtering a column is enough.**  
- **Use `FILTER` when conditions depend on multiple row-level evaluations.**

---

## 📖 **3. Other Factors: Readability & Maintainability**
| Method | Readability | Maintainability |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **CALCULATE (direct filter)** | ✅ **Easier to read** | ✅ **Easier to maintain** because it applies simple column filters. |
| **FILTER** | ❌ **More complex** | ❌ **Harder to maintain** for large datasets since it increases row evaluations. |

#### ✍️ **Example: Easier to Read Code**
```DAX
Total Sales Electronics =
CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales]), Orders[Category] = "Electronics")
```
✅ **Easy to read**  

Now compare this with:
```DAX
Total Sales Electronics Filter =
CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales]), FILTER(Orders, Orders[Category] = "Electronics"))
```
❌ **More complex** and unnecessary for simple filters.

---

## 🔄 **4. When to Use `FILTER` Instead of `CALCULATE`?**
Use **`FILTER`** only when:
1. You need **row-by-row** evaluation (e.g., `Quantity > 10 && Sales > 1000`).
2. Your filter condition **depends on multiple columns**.
3. You need to pass a **filtered table** into another function.

---

## 🏆 **Final Recommendation:**
| Situation | Best Approach |
|-----------|--------------|
| Filtering based on a single column | `CALCULATE( SUM(Orders[Sales]), Orders[Category] = "Electronics")` |
| Filtering with multiple **row-based** conditions | `FILTER(Orders, Orders[Quantity] > 10 && Orders[Category] = "Electronics")` |



### 🎯 **Conclusion**
- ✅ **Use `CALCULATE` for simple column filters** (Fastest, most efficient).  
- ✅ **Use `FILTER` when filtering depends on multiple row-based conditions** (Accurate but slower).  
- ✅ **Avoid unnecessary use of `FILTER` when CALCULATE can do the job** (Improves performance).

## 📊 **What Does "Works at the Row Level" Mean in DAX?**  

When we say a function **"works at the row level"**, it means that the function **evaluates each row individually** before returning a result. Some DAX functions, like `FILTER`, operate this way, meaning they check each row **one by one** to see if it meets the given condition.

### 📌 **Example: Row-Level vs. Context-Level Calculation**
Let’s take an example dataset:

| 🆔 Order ID | 🛍 Product  | 📂 Category  | 💰 Sales | 🔢 Quantity |
|---------|---------|-----------|------|----------|
| 101     | Laptop  | Electronics | 1000 | 5 |
| 102     | Mouse   | Electronics | 50   | 12 |
| 103     | Phone   | Electronics | 800  | 2 |
| 104     | Chair   | Furniture   | 200  | 15 |
| 105     | Table   | Furniture   | 500  | 8 |

---

### ✅ **1. `FILTER` Works at the Row Level**
The `FILTER` function checks **each row** one by one to see if it meets the condition.

#### 🏆 **Example: Total Sales Where Quantity > 10**
```DAX
Total Sales Large Orders = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]), 
    FILTER(Orders, Orders[Quantity] > 10)
)
```
#### 🔍 **How It Works Internally:**
- `FILTER(Orders, Orders[Quantity] > 10)` scans **each row** in the table.
- It **keeps only** the rows where `Quantity > 10`:
  - ✅ **Row 102: Mouse (Quantity = 12)**
  - ✅ **Row 104: Chair (Quantity = 15)**
- Then, `CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales]))` adds up only these rows:
  - 💵 **50 (Mouse) + 200 (Chair) = 250**  
✔️ **Result: 250**  


### 🔄 **2. `CALCULATE` Without `FILTER` (Context-Level)**
Now, let’s try the same calculation **without** using `FILTER`:

```DAX
Total Sales Electronics = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]), 
    Orders[Category] = "Electronics"
)
```
#### 🔍 **How It Works:**
- Instead of checking each row one by one, Power BI **modifies the entire filter context** by applying `Orders[Category] = "Electronics"`.
- It automatically keeps only the rows **where Category = "Electronics"**:
  - ✅ **Laptop (1000)**
  - ✅ **Mouse (50)**
  - ✅ **Phone (800)**
- Then, `SUM(Orders[Sales])` adds up those values:  
  ✔️ **Result: 1850**


### ⚖ **Key Difference Between Row-Level and Context-Level Filtering**
| 🔢 Function | ✅ Row-Level? | ⚙️ How It Works |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **FILTER** | ✅ **Yes** | Checks each row **individually** and returns only matching rows. |
| **CALCULATE** (with direct conditions) | ❌ No | Changes the **entire filter context** for the calculation. |
| **TOPN** | ✅ **Yes** | Evaluates each row and selects the top N rows based on a condition. |
| **ALL, ALLSELECTED, ALLEXCEPT** | ❌ No | Works at the **table level** by modifying the filter context. |


### 📌 **Final Summary**
1. **Row-Level Filtering (`FILTER`, `TOPN`)**  
   - Works **row by row** and returns a subset of the original table.
   - Used inside `CALCULATE`, `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`, etc.
   
2. **Context-Level Filtering (`CALCULATE`, `ALL`, `ALLEXCEPT`)**  
   - Changes the **entire filter context** before performing calculations.
   - More efficient for filtering **whole categories** instead of individual rows.


### ⚡ **Performance and Efficiency Considerations**
### 🏎️ **1. Speed (Performance) Differences**
| Method | ⚡ Speed | 📌 Reason |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **CALCULATE (with direct filters)** | 🚀 **Faster** | Works on **column-level filters** and modifies the filter context efficiently. |
| **FILTER (row-level filtering)** | 🐢 **Slower** | Iterates through **each row** individually, increasing computation time. |

#### 🏆 **Example: Performance Test**
#### ✅ **Using CALCULATE for filtering**
```DAX
Total Sales Electronics = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]), 
    Orders[Category] = "Electronics"
)
```
✅ **Faster** because Power BI directly **filters the column** and applies the condition in a single step.  

#### ❌ **Using FILTER for the same calculation**
```DAX
Total Sales Electronics Filter = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]), 
    FILTER(Orders, Orders[Category] = "Electronics")
)
```
❌ **Slower** because:
1. FILTER scans **each row** instead of applying a direct column filter.
2. It checks **each row individually** before aggregation.

👉 **Conclusion**:  
- ✔️ **CALCULATE directly applies the filter at the column level**, making it **more efficient**.  
- ✔️ **FILTER evaluates row by row**, making it **slower**, especially for large datasets.
