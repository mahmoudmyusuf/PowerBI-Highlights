# Time Intelligence in Power BI

Time Intelligence in Power BI refers to a set of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions that enable users to perform time-based calculations efficiently. These functions help analyze trends, compare periods, and calculate cumulative values over time, making them essential for financial, sales, and operational reporting.

## Key Features of Time Intelligence

### 1. Period Comparisons
These functions allow you to compare data from different time periods, such as:
- Year-over-Year (YoY), Month-over-Month (MoM), and Week-over-Week (WoW) comparisons.

Example: Year-over-Year Sales Comparison
```DAX
YoY Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Calendar[Date]))
```
This formula calculates the total sales for the same period in the previous year.

### 2. Cumulative Aggregations
You can calculate cumulative values like running totals or year-to-date (YTD), quarter-to-date (QTD), and month-to-date (MTD) values.

Example: Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales Calculation
```DAX
Sales YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Calendar[Date])
```
This formula accumulates sales from the beginning of the year to the current date.

### 3. Moving Averages
Moving averages smooth out trends over a rolling period to identify long-term patterns.

Example: 30-Day Moving Average of Sales
```DAX
Moving Average = AVERAGEX(DATESINPERIOD(Calendar[Date], MAX(Calendar[Date]), -30, DAY), [Total Sales])
```
This calculates the average sales for the last 30 days, helping to track trends over time.

### 4. Shifting Time Periods
These functions allow comparisons with previous periods, such as the previous month or previous quarter.

Example: Previous Month Sales Calculation
```DAX
Previous Month Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), PREVIOUSMONTH(Calendar[Date]))
```
This formula retrieves the total sales for the previous month.

### 5. Custom Fiscal Calendars
If your organization follows a fiscal year instead of a calendar year, you can create custom calculations based on your fiscal periods.

Example: Fiscal Year-to-Date Calculation
```DAX
Fiscal YTD Sales = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Calendar[Date], "06-30")
```
This formula calculates YTD sales, assuming the fiscal year ends on June 30th.

## Prerequisites for Time Intelligence Functions
To use Time Intelligence functions effectively, you need:
1. A **continuous date table** that spans the required time range.
2. The date table must be marked as a **Date Table** in Power BI. You can do this by selecting the table and clicking "Mark as Date Table" in the **Modeling** tab.

## Steps to Create a Calendar Table

This Markdown file provides clear instructions and a DAX script to create a Calendar Dimension table in Power BI. Let me know if you need any modifications or additional details!


### 1. Create a New Table in Power BI
Use the following DAX formula in the **Modeling** tab by selecting **New Table**:

#### A. Using CALENDARAUTO()
`CALENDARAUTO()` does not provide a built-in way to exclude specific date columns from the dataset. It automatically scans all date columns in the model and determines the minimum and maximum dates to generate a continuous date range. 

```DAX
Calendar = CALENDARAUTO()
```

#### B. Using CALENDAR()

`CALENDAR()` can be used instead of **CALENDARAUTO** If you know the exact date range you want, you can manually define it using:
* manually defined start and end dates, 

```DAX
Calendar = CALENDAR(DATE(2020,1,1), DATE(2030,12,31))
```
* or can be integrated with calcuated MinDate and MaxDate. 
```DAX
Calendar = CALENDAR(MIN(Orders[Order Date]),max(Orders[Ship Date]))
```

After using one of the two options above we can add calcuated columns one by one to target any required date format.


<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="img/new_column.png" alt="Project Image" width="800" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/new_column2.png" alt="Project Image" width="800" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> ```DAX
> Qtr-year = "Qrt " & FORMAT('Calendar'[Date],"Q-yyyy")
> ```
```DAX
Calendar =
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(DATE(2020,1,1), DATE(2030,12,31)),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),
    "Month Number", MONTH([Date]),
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),
    "Weekday", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
    "Weekday Number", WEEKDAY([Date], 2), -- Monday = 1
    "Year-Month", FORMAT([Date], "YYYY-MM"),
    "Year-Quarter", FORMAT([Date], "YYYY") & "-Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),
    "Day of Year", FORMAT([Date], "DDD")
)
```

### 2. Explanation of Columns
- **Date**: The base date range from 2020 to 2030 (adjust as needed).
- **Year**: Extracts the year.
- **Month**: Full month name (e.g., January, February).
- **Month Number**: Numeric representation of the month.
- **Quarter**: Quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, etc.).
- **Weekday**: Full day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
- **Weekday Number**: Numeric representation of the weekday (Monday as 1).
- **Year-Month**: Concatenation of year and month for easier filtering.
- **Year-Quarter**: Concatenation of year and quarter.
- **Day of Year**: Day number within the year.

### 3. Best Practices
- Ensure the Calendar table has a relationship with the fact table using the **Date** column.
- Mark the table as a **Date Table** in Power BI (**Modeling** â†’ **Mark as Date Table**).
- Add additional columns like Fiscal Year or Holidays if needed.

### 4. Customization
Adjust the `CALENDAR` function range based on your data requirements. Add more columns for fiscal periods, holidays, or ISO weeks as needed.

## Conclusion
Creating a well-structured Calendar Dimension table enhances time-based analysis and allows for efficient filtering and calculations in Power BI reports.
