# Creating a Calendar Dimension in DAX

## Overview
A Calendar Dimension table is essential for time-based analysis in Power BI. This guide provides a DAX script to create a Calendar table.

## Steps to Create a Calendar Table

### 1. Create a New Table in Power BI
Use the following DAX formula in the **Modeling** tab by selecting **New Table**:

```DAX
Calendar =
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(DATE(2020,1,1), DATE(2030,12,31)),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),
    "Month Number", MONTH([Date]),
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),
    "Weekday", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
    "Weekday Number", WEEKDAY([Date], 2), -- Monday = 1
    "Year-Month", FORMAT([Date], "YYYY-MM"),
    "Year-Quarter", FORMAT([Date], "YYYY") & "-Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),
    "Day of Year", FORMAT([Date], "DDD")
)
```

### 2. Explanation of Columns
- **Date**: The base date range from 2020 to 2030 (adjust as needed).
- **Year**: Extracts the year.
- **Month**: Full month name (e.g., January, February).
- **Month Number**: Numeric representation of the month.
- **Quarter**: Quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, etc.).
- **Weekday**: Full day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
- **Weekday Number**: Numeric representation of the weekday (Monday as 1).
- **Year-Month**: Concatenation of year and month for easier filtering.
- **Year-Quarter**: Concatenation of year and quarter.
- **Day of Year**: Day number within the year.

### 3. Best Practices
- Ensure the Calendar table has a relationship with the fact table using the **Date** column.
- Mark the table as a **Date Table** in Power BI (**Modeling** â†’ **Mark as Date Table**).
- Add additional columns like Fiscal Year or Holidays if needed.

### 4. Customization
Adjust the `CALENDAR` function range based on your data requirements. Add more columns for fiscal periods, holidays, or ISO weeks as needed.

## Conclusion
Creating a well-structured Calendar Dimension table enhances time-based analysis and allows for efficient filtering and calculations in Power BI reports.
